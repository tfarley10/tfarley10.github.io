      <description>Introduction In part 1 while exploring the dataset I stated two a priori beliefs about the relationship between building age and rental price. First, especially when taking selection bias, this relationship is unlikely to be linear (or log-linear in this case). Second, I suggested that the relationship was likely to be different in different types of neighborhoods. In this post, I’ll start by specifying a statistical model that addresses the mediating effects of ‘Neighborhood Income level’, non-linearities, and confounding variable bias.</description>
