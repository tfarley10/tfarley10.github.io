      <description>Intro In the last post, after specifying a statistical model for the the effects of age on rent in the Streeteasy dataset, I fit that model and graphically compared it to a linear model. I pointed out that one advantage of the splines model is that it allowed me to identify in a more granular way how cohort effects could bias my inference. While the overally goal of this analysis is to infer the causal effects of age on rental price a sub-goal of this process is to build a model that describes the underlying data-generating process well.</description>
